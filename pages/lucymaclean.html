<h1>Lucy MacLean</h1>
<p><strong><i>Lucy</i></strong> is an active contributor to the well-being of her community, such as doing Vault
    maintenance using her repair
    skills, or gardening. She relishes being challenged, such as shooting with rifles, doing wrestling, fencing and
    gymnastics. However, she acknowledges her aim with guns is not always the best. She enjoys reading, watching movies
    and learning about history.

    <br>
    She has been described as being kind, charming, plucky, and strong. Lucy strongly believes in the Golden Rule, which
    is to treat others as one wishes to be treated.Lucy is confident that she can improve things, fueled by her optimism
    of the retro-America she was raised to admire. An optimistic, hard-working person, Lucy has an inherent belief that
    humanity is generally good and that there is goodness in the world that can prevail over evil. However, she
    struggles to maintain this belief the more she explores the wasteland, becoming more cynical as she becomes aware of
    suffering, violence and death. Her personality goes through a transformation when she finds herself betrayed and
    attacked by humanity, making her tougher and wiser, even if she becomes emotionally overwhelmed sometimes.<br>
