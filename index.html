    <h2 id="Plot"><u>Plot </u></h2>
    <p> Fallout is set in 2296, 219 years after the Great War of 2077, which killed the vast majority of humanity in a
        nuclear holocaust. It is also set 9 years after Fallout 4. It is heavily implied that Fallout begins near the
        end of 2296, as a terminal mentions it is 2297 by episode 5, and <strong><i><u>Lucy</u></i></strong><a
                href="#LucyMacLean"> (look) </a> mentions while leaving Vault 4 she has only been on the surface for
        two weeks. During the Great War, some citizens of pre-War America managed to
        survive the war in Vaults, massive fallout shelters constructed by the Vault-Tec Corporation across the United
        States, and Fallout focuses on their descendants.Lucy MacLean is a resident of one such Vault: Vault 33, located
        in the ruined city of Los Angeles. She has spent her life underground and is currently applying to have a
        husband from another Vault in an arranged marriage. After a tragic event involving a woman named Lee Moldaver,
        Lucy decides to leave for the surface on a mission to save her father Hank. As she becomes accustomed to the
        dangers of the wasteland, she encounters other characters including <strong><i><u>Maximus</u></i></strong><a
                href="#Maximus"> (look)</a>, a
        young soldier in the Brotherhood
        of Steel, as well as <strong><i><u>the Ghoul</u></i></strong><a href="#TheGhoul">(look)</a>, a ghoulified
        bounty
        hunter.The protagonists' paths converge as they chase an
        artifact from an enigmatic researcher nammed Siggi Wilzig which has the potential to reshape the power dynamic
        of the entire wasteland. Other perspectives include that of pre-War Hollywood star Cooper Howard, the man who
        became the Ghoul; as well as the continued story of Vault 33's dwellers after Lucy leaves on her journey, shown
        through the perspective of her brother Norm MacLean.

            <p><strong><i>Maximus</i></strong> is a rookie soldier who grew up above ground but, like Lucy, was also
                raised in a cloistered "family" of sorts: the Brotherhood of Steel. However, unlike Lucy, he has a
                cynical sense of self-preservation and does not always act honorably.
                He has recently been elevated to the rank of squire and is sent by the Brotherhood with his knight as an
                expendable assistant. His mission leads him towards an artifact from an enigmatic researcher called
                Siggi Wilzig, causing his path to collide with those of Lucy and the Ghoul.<br>
